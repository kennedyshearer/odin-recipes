    <h3>Description</h3>

        This recipe for conch fritters with a delicious dipping sauce is 
        a traditional Bahamian recipe. Conch is a wonderful shellfish that 
        is delicious but so hard to find outside of the Bahamas. 
        These fritters are great as an appetizer, finger food, or as a very 
        tasty hors d'oeuvre to accompany your favorite tropical drink!
