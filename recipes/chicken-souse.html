        your individual taste. It's delicious and surprisingly simple!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>24 chicken wings, separated</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>½ green pepper, diced</li>
        <li>6 large potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>3 carrots, diced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>¾ cup lime juice</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Toss the chicken wings with 3 tablespoons lime juice and 
            the seasoned salt. Set aside to marinate at room temperature 
            for 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. 
            Add the onion and green pepper; cook and stir until the onion
            has softened and begun to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the 
            potatoes, carrots, red pepper flakes, allspice, bay leaves, 
            marinated chicken, lime juice, and water. Bring to a simmer, 
            then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and continue simmering 
            until the chicken is no longer pink at the bone, and the 
            vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes. Season to taste with 
            salt and pepper before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
